          Hi, I am Sadia, a Software Engineer. I am located in the Waterloo
          region but open to work in the GTA. I am a recent Computer Science
          graduate from Western University with a minor in French .
        </p>
        <p>
          My love for coding came from the first year I was in University. I was
          required to take a programming course where I learned the basics of
          Java. Since I love mathematics, this felt similar in the sense that it
          was a problem with a certain algorithm required to solve it. I ended
          up switching my major to Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing my degree, I completed Software Engineering bootcamp
          at Brainstation to help expand my knowledge on full stack skills I
          didn't previously know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I love to read, I enjoy getting recommendations
          from others. I love animals, if I could live with 50 dogs I would. I
          also love to travel and try foods of different cultures.
