          Hi, I am Sadia, a Software Engineer based in the Waterloo region, open
          to work in the GTA. I recently graduated from Western University with
          a degree in Computer Science and a minor in French .
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for coding began in the first year of university. I was
          required to take an introductory Java course where I learned the
          basics of coding. I was drawn to the problem-solving aspect of
          programming. Since I love math, this felt similar in the sense that it
          was a problem with a certain set algorithm. That is when I switched my
          major to Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing my degree, I completed the Software Engineering
          bootcamp at Brainstation to strengthen my full-stack development
          skills and expand my knowledge beyond what I had learned in school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I love reading (always open to recommendations!),
          traveling, and trying foods from different cultures. I am also a huge
          animal lover, I would live with 50 dogs if I could!
